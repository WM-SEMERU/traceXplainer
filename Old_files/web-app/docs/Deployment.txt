For Tower1 Specifically:

To be able to access the website correctly, we need two separate servers running:

React-Frontend:
 1) When logged in, change to SU access privileges: 'sudo su'
 2) Go to /home/semeru/Neural-Unsupervised-Software-Traceability/web-app/tminerWebApp
 3) Run the command 'yarn start'

Flask-Backend:
 1) after having started the frontend, go to the api/ folder in the same area
 2) Run the command 'python3 api.py'

Database-Backend and Jenkins:

For the Jenkins piece, you'll need to connect to a git repo with a webhook. This is done on both sides,
Jenkins and git. That will trigger the build, which executes arbitrary code on the tower 1. We use it
to run the backend script (create_baseline.py) which creates a database for the flask backend to access.
